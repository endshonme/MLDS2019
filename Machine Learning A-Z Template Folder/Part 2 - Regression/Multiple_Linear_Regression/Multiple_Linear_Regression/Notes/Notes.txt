***Dummy variable trap***

One or several variables predict other is called Multicollinearity.

In this cases the model couldn't distinguish the effects of D1 from D2.

We cannot have constant and dummy variables at the same time.

Always omit one dummy variable.
If we have n dummy variables, consider only n-1 dummy variables.

Backward Elimination
Some variables have much effects
const - X0
city 1 - x1
rand d - x2
adm - x3
mark -x4
