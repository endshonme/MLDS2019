The features should be of the same scale.
Because of Euclidean distance calculations complexity, the features with higher value would
dominate.

Age Salaray
44	72000
48	79000

So, Age and Salary should be feature scaled.

Standardisation and Normalisation are two ways of scaling the features.
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc_X = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc_X.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc_X.transform(X_test)

Dummy variables need not be scaled, but to just let everything to be on the same scale we do it.

Most of the times Feature Scaling is not used as it is already included in the libraries itself.
